# Smart-Job-Alerts

 📬 Smart Job Alerts

Automatically find and receive job alerts tailored to your resume and job preferences. This app scans job postings, compares them to your resume using an LLM (via OpenRouter), and emails you top matches with a match score and explanation.

🎯 Goal

Manually searching job boards is time-consuming. Smart Job Alerts automates this by:

Fetching fresh job listings from the JSearch API (via RapidAPI)

Using your resume and a prompt template to assess relevance using LLMs (e.g., Moonshot/Kimi-K2 via OpenRouter)

Emailing you the top job matches with detailed feedback

🚀 Two Ways to Use This App

Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Automatic Alerts)

Automatically run the job matching every day (or on schedule) using GitHub Actions.

Option 2: Use Docker Locally (Manual Alerts)

Run the app manually using a Docker image. Recommended if you prefer CLI over GitHub automation.

🧠 How It Works

You provide a resume (PDF) and a prompt template.

Jobs are fetched from RapidAPI.

For each job, the full job description + qualifications/responsibilities are passed to an LLM.

The LLM scores each job and provides a justification.

Matching jobs are emailed to you using Gmail SMTP.
